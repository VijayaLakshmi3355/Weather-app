# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- ☀️🌧️❄️☁️ Icons for different weather conditions.


## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **React.js**⚛️ (JavaScript library for building the user interface)
- **OpenWeatherMap API**🌐 (For fetching weather data)
- **CSS**🎨 (For styling the app)
